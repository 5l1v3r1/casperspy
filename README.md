**Possible_Otorun8** is false detection
I admit I did made autorun batch script on casperlauncher installer precisely in **start.bat**
you can find this script on casperlauncher folder **C:\Program Files\CasperLauncher**
this script will install & register activex component before casperlauncher starting up.

If i didn’t do it error notification _**“missing or corrupt codejock~1 component”**_ will appear
This is the content of **Start.bat** script:

`@echo off`
`echo :: ---------------------------------------`
`echo :: Install and Register activex components`
`echo :: ---------------------------------------`
`pause`
`for %%f in (*.ocx *.dll) do regsvr32 /s %%f`
`echo :: -------`
`echo :: Succeed`
`echo :: -------`
`echo :: --------------------`
`echo :: start CasperLauncher`
`echo :: --------------------`
`pause`
`start casperlauncher.exe`
